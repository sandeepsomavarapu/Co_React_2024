React


NextJS:
=======

Next Js is react framework for building web apps

React

	its not feasible to create fully-featured application  ready for production
	
	react is a library for building user interfaces
	
npm install react-router-dom --save
	
	as a programmer we need make decisions about other features like routing,data fetching and ..

	NEXT JS
		it uses react for building user interfaces 
		provides additional features that enables you to create production ready apps
		these features includes routing,optimized rendering,data fetching,compiling,bundling and more..
		you dont need to install any additional packages as nextjs providing everything for us

npm install create-next-app

create-next-app projectname		-->page.tsx  -->layout

npx creat-next-app name

	npm run dev ->this command will setup devlopment server on localhost 3000



React Server Component(RSC):new feature in react 18

1.server components
2.client components


in next js all components are server components by default,
which have ability to to run tasks 
like reading files and fetching data from database

but no ability to use hooks or handle user interactions


Client components:(react components)
==================

to create client component,its necessary to add "use client" at the top component,
which have no ability to run tasks like reading files and fetching data from database
but have ability to use hooks or handle user interactions



next js has file system based routing mechanisam
url paths that users can access in the browsers are defined by files and folders in our codebase


routing conventions:
	all routes must be placed inside the app folder
	every file that corresponds to a route must be named as page.js/page.tsx
	every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL
